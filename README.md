# Mercor Forms
Live at âœ¨: [https://mercor-form.vercel.app](https://mercor-form.vercel.app/ "Mercor Forms")

Mercor Forms is my submission to Mercor's Fullstack Coding Challenge as a part of the fullstack developer role application.

The project is a clone of Google Forms, allowing users to create forms and share with the world. Mercor Forms provides creators with granular control and ways to visualize the responses in a beautiful diagramatic way like pie charts.
